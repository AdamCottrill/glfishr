Description: glfishr contains a series of R functions that are
    intended to make it easy to get fisheries assessment data from the
    fn_portal api and into R for subsequent analysis and reporting.
    Functions are named semantically to reflect the FN-II table they fetch
    data from (e.g. get_FN011() for project meta data, get_FN121() for net
    set/sample data and get_FN125() for biological sample data).  Most of
    the functions take an optional filter_list parameter that can be used
    to finely control which records are returned.  Care has been taken to
    ensure that the available filters are consistent with FN-II field
    names whenever possible, and in many cases, filters can be re-used
    across different tables (e.g. - if a filter is passed to the
    get_FN121() function to find a subset of net sets, that same filter
    can be applied to the get_FN125() function to get the all of the
    biological samples collected in those net sets).
