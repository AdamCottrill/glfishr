\title{Get FN122 - Effort data from FN_Portal API}
\usage{
get_FN122(filter_list = list(), show_id = FALSE, to_upper = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{filter_list}{list}

\item{show_id}{When 'FALSE', the default, the 'id' and 'slug'
fields are hidden from the data frame. To return these columns
as part of the data frame, use 'show_id = TRUE'.}

\item{to_upper}{\itemize{
\item should the names of the dataframe be converted to
upper case?
}}
}
\value{
dataframe

\description{
This function accesses the api endpoint to for FN122
records. FN122 records contain information about efforts within a
sample.  For most gill netting project an effort corresponds to a
single panel of a particular mesh size within a net set
(gang). For Trap netting and trawling projects, there is usually
just a single effort. The FN122 table contains information about
that particular effort such as gear depth, gear temperature at set
and lift, and effort distance.  This function takes an optional
filter list which can be used to return records based on several
attributes of the effort including effort distance and depth but
also attributes of the projects or nets set they are associated
with such project code, lake, first year, last year, protocol,
gear etc.
