\description{
This function accesses the api endpoint to for SC125 Lamprey
records. SC125 Lam records contain information about the individual
lamprey wounds observed on a sampled fish.  Historically, lamprey
wounds were reported as a single field (XLAM) in the SC125 table.
In the early 2000 the Great Lakes fishery community agreed to
capture lamprey wounding data in a more consistent fashion the
basin, using the conventions described in Ebener et al. 2006.  The
SC125Lam table captures data from individual lamprey wounds
collected using those conventions.  A sampled fish with no
observed wound will have a single record in this table (with
lamijc value of 0), while fish with lamprey wounds, will have one
record for every observed wound. This function takes an optional
filter list which can be used to return records based on several
different attributes of the wound (wound type, degree of healing,
and wound size) as well as, attributes of the sampled
fish such as the species, or group code, or attributes of the
interview, or the creel(s) that the samples were collected in.
