\description{
This function accesses the api endpoint for FN121_Electrofishing
records. FN121_Electrofishing records contain information about
electrofishing sampling events, including shocking seconds, volts,
amps, and power used for each SAM. Other relevant details for the SAM
are found in the FN121 and optionally the FN121_GPS_Tracks tables.
This function takes an optional filter list which can be used to
return records based on attributes of the SAM including start and end
date and time, effort duration, gear, site depth and location as well as
attributes of the projects they are associated with such project
code, or part of the project code, lake, first year, last year,
protocol, etc.
