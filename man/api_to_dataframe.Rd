\description{
Given a url submit the request and return the results as a
dataframe. If the response is paginated, the functions is called
recursively until all of the pages have been loaded ($next is
null). A maximum of 20 requests are made.  If the maximum number of
pages is reached, the function returns the data and issues a
warning that there may be additional data and that the filters
should be refined and multiple requests made and then combined to
ensure that all of the records selected by the filter are returned.
It is generally considered best practice to only request the data
needed for your particular analysis by applying appropriate filters
to the request than fetch everything and filtering on the client
(e.g. R).
