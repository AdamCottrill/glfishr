\title{Get TFAT Tag Recovery Reports}
\usage{
get_tfat_reports(filter_list = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{filter_list}{list}
}
\value{
dataframe
}
\description{
This function accesses the TFAT api endpoint for tag reports - tag reports
are anglers, the general public, or other agencies.  A tag report can have
one or many associated tags (ie. tag recoveries).  Every tag recovery has
only one tag report. Tag reports include the reporting date and method, and
whether or not a follow-up letter  was requested.
}
\details{
This function takes an optional filter list which can be used to return
records based on several attributes of the reporting event (reporting date,
reporting method, or follow-up requested), the tagged fish such as species or
size, or the tag attributes such as colour, placement, or tag type.

See http://10.167.37.157/tfat/api/redoc/#report for the full list of
available filter keys (query parameters)

# tags recovered in Lake Huron between 2012 and 2018
reports <- get_tfat_reports(list(
  lake = "ON", year__gte = 2012, year__lte =

))

# yellow or orange tags recovered in Lake Superior
reports <- get_tfat_reports(list(lake = "SU", tag__colour = c("2,5")))
